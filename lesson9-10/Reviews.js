          <h1>✩✩✩ Iced Oatmilk Lavendar Matchas</h1>
          <p>
            The iced lavendar matchas are by far the worst drinks you'd ever have to make as a barista. Easy to make a WHOLE mess with the matcha powder. Not to mention you have to add another powder to make the lavendar cold foam.

          <h1>⭐️✩✩ Caramel Ribbon Crunch</h1>
          <p>Easily the worst frappucino you will have to make. Requires multiple layers of whip cream and the caramel crunch topping goes everywhere when you sprinkle it. Often causes you to have to make caramel backups frequently.</p>

          <h1>⭐️⭐️✩ Strawberry Acai Lemonade</h1>
          <p>Making any of the refreshers are relatively easy and straightforward, except this one. While the easiest modification is no strawberry inclusions, many customers like to add peach juice, syrups, and foams to the drink.</p>

        <h1>⭐️⭐️⭐️ Iced Chai Tea Latte</h1>
        <p>One of the easiest drinks to make. Simply pump the chai concentrate, add the milk and top it off with ice cubes. Difficulty can increase if customer adds a cold foam, but still relatively easy compared to other drinks. Not to mention people who get iced chais are normally super nice and polite (some of my favorite customers!)</p>
